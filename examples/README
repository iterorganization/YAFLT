flt1:

Example of using the library with pre-defined equilibrium data from EQ3.eqdsk
and obtaining a fieldline from a given starting point.


flt2:

Example of using the library with pre-defined equilibrium data from EQ3.eqdsk
and the pre-defined target mesh from inres1 and calculating fieldlines from
the barycenters of the triangles from the mesh.

flt3:

Same as flt2, except that in this case, based on the input normals we
correctly determine the direction we should follow the fieldlines and
calculating the magnetic vector from the given EQ3.eqdsk data set in Cartesian
coordinate system.
