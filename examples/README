flt1:

Example of using the library with pre-defined equilibrium data from EQ3.eqdsk
and obtaining a fieldline from a given starting point.


flt2:

Example of using the library with pre-defined equilibrium data from EQ3.eqdsk
and the pre-defined target mesh from inres1 and calculating fieldlines from
the barycenters of the triangles from the mesh.

flt3:

Same as flt2, except that in this case, based on the input normals we
correctly determine the direction we should follow the fieldlines and
calculating the magnetic vector from the given EQ3.eqdsk data set in Cartesian
coordinate system.

inres1_example:

Runs the inres1 case. This is a limited equilibrium, touching FWP #4. The input
data is included in headers:
    data_for_shadow.h
        Shadowing geometry data, used for intersection tests.
    data_for_target.h
        Target geometry data.
    data_for_spline.h
        Equilibrium data, aka 'EQ3.eqdsk'

The binary then creates a simple vtk file, containing the connection length
information and the intersection mask arrays.

embreeTest1.cpp:

A simple usage of Embree API, where we have two triangles and a on a finite ray
we check for intersection.

embreeTest2.cpp:

Simple check if loading a geometry to Embree is successful.
