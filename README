# L2G C++

## Introduction

This is a FLT kernel that contains the minimum amount of required functions to
run Field Line-Tracing in a tokamak, using axisymmetric equilibrium data.

## Building

In order to build it, CMake can be used. Embree is the only dependency that is
required and it is found via CMake Find functions.


## Debug build CMake

In order to have LSP-clangd functionality in editors for easier programming, we
need to configure the project in Debug configuration with the flag
CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON.

```
cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug /path/to/source
```

Then run the following command to get the JSON file LSP-clangd is using:

compdb -p /path/to/build/ list > /path/to/source/compile_commands.json
