# L2G C++

## Introduction

This is a FLT kernel that contains the minimum amount of required functions to
run Field Line-Tracing in a tokamak, using axisymmetric equilibrium data.

## Building

In order to build it, CMake can be used. Embree is the only dependency that is
required and it is found via CMake Find functions.


## Debug build CMake for IDE editor

In case you are using an editor with LSP plugins or functionality and you have
installed the LSP-clangd plugin, the following steps has to be performed in
order to have the LSP-clangd enhanced experience.



### Generate the compile build JSON file

When compiling pass the the flag ``-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON``. This
will generate a JSON file that gives the LSP information on compilation steps
and flags used.

```
cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug /path/to/source
```

### Process the JSON file for LSP-clangd

For this you need to install the ``compdb`` python package

```
pip install compdb
```

When you have the CMake build output file, process it with the ``compdb``
command. The new file has to be positioned in the sources, so that LSP-clangd
registers it.

```
compdb -p /path/to/build/ list > /path/to/source/compile_commands.json
```
