test_1_rkf45_stability.cpp - Tests the stability of the method by following a
    magnetic surface for a large number of steps. At each step evaluate if the
    new position is still on the magnetic surface or how much it differs from
    the initial flux value (should be constant). Of course the resolution of
    the input data affects the accuracy, nonetheless, the method itself should
    have some control over it.
