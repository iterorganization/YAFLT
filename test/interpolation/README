test_1_accuracy.cpp - Tests the accuracy of the interpolation by intepolating
    an analytical function (x - a)**2 * (y - b)**2 and seeing how many points
    differ by more than .01%. It outputs a huge amount of text which can then
    be used to debug in which regions the algorithm has issues (if you plot you
    should see an L band). Use the plot_points.py on the output of the program.

test_2_serial_performance.cpp - Measures the time the algorithm computes N
    values in serial mode.

test_3_omp_performance.cpp - Measures the time the algorithm computes N values
    in serial and parallel mode. For evaluating performance scalability.

test_4_finite_difference_check.cpp - Checking the derivative tables if
    they are written exactly the same. Could be used to see different schemas
    to be used to calculate derivative values.
